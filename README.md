# moviereview
<ul>
  <li>One of the first projects I did using Django</li>
    <li>Learnt about how to interact with models and views, The Post is a model and we send the model to the view using the post id</li>
    <li>Learnt about how to use Foreign key in the models and display the information of a child from the parent in the views</li>
    <li>The frontend is very basic html css, the primary goal was to learn the backend</li>
    <li>This can be used as a personal  movie review website where the movies and their reviews will be added using the Djangos inbuilt site administration</li>
    <li>The inbuilt site administration can be navigated by using sitename/admin</li>
  </ul>
A simple django project about movie reviews which is deployed to Heroku https://intense-atoll-17185.herokuapp.com/
